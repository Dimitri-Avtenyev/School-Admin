# SchoolAdmin

## Introduction
SchoolAdmin is a school project developed as part of my coursework to learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C# and .NET. This project was created based on the curriculum outlined in [Zie Scherp - Scherper](https://apwt.gitbook.io/zie-scherp-scherper), focusing on practical implementations of OOP principles.

## Curriculum Highlights
The project incorporates concepts and exercises from various chapters of the curriculum:
- **Chapter 1: Introduction to OOP**
  - Understanding the principles of OOP and their significance in software development.
  
- **Chapter 2: Classes and Objects**
  - Implementing classes and defining object behavior and attributes.

- **Chapter 3: Inheritance**
  - Demonstrating inheritance relationships to promote code reuse and hierarchy.

- **Chapter 4: Polymorphism**
  - Applying polymorphic behaviors to achieve flexibility in program design.

- **Chapter 5: Abstraction**
  - Utilizing abstract classes and interfaces to define generic types and behaviors.

- **Chapter 6: Encapsulation**
  - Applying encapsulation principles to hide implementation details and promote modularity.

## Features
- **OOP Concepts**: Implements key OOP principles such as inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Class Hierarchy**: Uses an abstract classes from which specific entities are derived.
- **Console Interface**: Utilizes a simple console interface for user interaction.

## Usage
To run SchoolAdmin, ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/schooladmin.git
cd schooladmin
dotnet run
